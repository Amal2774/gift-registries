<p>Welcome to Our Domestic Union Prank

  Ashley and I really are excited to have so much of our family here visiting and we thought it was the perfect opportunity to let them share in our love. And I really do think Domestic Partnerships are getting the shaft on the celebration end. Whatever your relationship status, even if “it’s complicated”, if you love someone you should shout it from the rooftops occasionally. That’s what we’re doing here.
  The celebration dinner and registry surprise are an elaborate ruse, I know; but should be fun. There are seven registries to choose from. You want to be part of the fun, cool, but no gifts are expected or needed. The items are random and messed up, so if you want to check out all the registries, I promise you won’t be disappointed. We're blessed already. But it IS messed up there are no civil union registries. Just saying. Thanks everybody, Zac & Ashley
